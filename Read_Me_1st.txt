    App Synopsis:       This app will appear to your HP41C/CV/CX as an HP 82143A printer
                        when using Diego Diaz's USB-45 HP41 interface.  As long as the
                        USB-41 interface is properly connected, and remains connected,
                        your HP41C/CV/CX will continue to see it as the available printer.
                        
    This app is very simple and extremely intuitive but here are some basic instructions:
    
    1.  Plug the USB-41 interface into a port on the back of your HP41
        - turn the HP41 off and on again to be sure the serial port registers with your Mac
        
    2.  Fire up the HP41SerialReader application
